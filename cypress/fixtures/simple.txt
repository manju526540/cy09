This page allows you to upload a file. Note that the script will limit the size of the file to around 50k (so that the server doesn't get swamped with data).

The file upload form looks just like any other form except that:

the form tag must specify the POST method
the form tag must specify an enctype of multipart/form-data
the form must contain an <input type=file> element.
You can do a view source on this document to see all the elements.
